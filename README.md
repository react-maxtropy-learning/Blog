#Introduction#
I will share some my own thoughts and ideas about programming and something else in this blog. I have to say I don't like writing a blog, especially an English version.  However, I found it is necessary. Not only for the participant to improve his or her English, but also to share my own thoughts aiming at helping those who want to build thenmselves. Furthermore, it is my honour to see someone else share their good thoughts with me. To some degree, it is not a blog, but a platform for communication.

#Theme List#
- ##Theory##
Boring but important, will be introduced mre specific in the futrue.  
- ##Front-End##
It goes without saying that we should add this one in the theme list.
- ##Back-End##
Although we are working as front-end engineers, we can not ignore back-end skills.  Without these skills, you will lost one third or even more skills of front-end. In my opinion, Python and Node should be our focus for Python is the most valuable language in the future and Javascript is the most popular language for now. Besides, python is not only useful for establishing a back-end server, but also meaningful for other fields such as artificial.
- ##Client##
In my thought, this theme is about native app developing such as Androidï¼ŒiOS, ReactNative, Rax, Weex and so on. We can treat these things as competitor with H5. For my working position, I like H5. For my own favourite, I prefer Swift which is created by Apple for developing iOS. But for further interest, I think this field should be chaos like today even more chaos in the future. However, we should remember that we could never believe that we want to believe.
- ##Books##
Introducing good books I am reading.
- ##Thoughts##
